## Post Order Traversal

### When to use:

Whenever we need to calculate something at each node in a binary tree using values from that node's left and right subtrees, we need to use post-order traversal. This is because we need to ensure that we have already processed the left and right children before processing the parent node.


It uses bottom up approach, where we first process the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the node itself.
