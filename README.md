Welcome to the "Algorithms and Data Structures in Python" repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of various algorithms and data structures implemented using Python 3.

## Prerequisites

To make the most out of this repository, it is recommended to have a basic understanding of Python programming language. If you are new to Python, you can start with the [Python Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/introduction) guide provided by Google Developers.

### Downloading and Installing

To begin, you will need to download and install Python on your local machine. The latest version of Python can be obtained from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once installed, ensure that Python is set up correctly by adding it to your environment variables. If you need assistance with this step, you can refer to [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jyOHCTgWpg) by Alok Tripathi.

## Implemented Solutions

In this repository, we have provided a wide range of solutions for different algorithms and data structures. The following topics are covered:

* Loops and Recursion
* Arrays and Matrices
* Linked Lists
* Queues
* Stacks
* Heaps
* Sets and Hash Maps
* Trees
* Binary Search
* Graphs
* DFS, BFS, and Backtracking
* Tries
* Merge Sort and Quick Sort

## Other Important Problems for Interviews

Apart from the core topics, we have included solutions for various important problems that often arise during technical interviews:

* Dynamic Programming (Memoization and Divide-and-Conquer)
* Problems with Multiple Pointers or Sliding Windows
* Greedy Algorithms
* Logical/Mathematical Proof Techniques (contradiction, contrapositive, induction, cases)
* Object-Oriented Programming (It is recommended to check out "Clean Code" by Robert Martin, especially the sections on the Single Responsibility Principle. Though not crucial for interviews, it is valuable to know.)
