## Coding Guidelines

### Python Style
- Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) guidelines
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length of 79 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add type hints where appropriate

### Git Practices

#### Commit Messages
- Use clear and descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb in the present tense (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update")
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Add detailed description if needed after a blank line

#### Changing Commit Messages

1. **For the most recent commit:**
   ```bash
   git commit --amend -m "New commit message"
   ```

2. **For older commits:**
   ```bash
   # Show last n commits
   git rebase -i HEAD~n

   # In the editor, change 'pick' to 'reword' for commits you want to modify
   # Save and close the editor
   # Enter new commit message in the next editor
   ```

3. **If you've already pushed to remote:**
   ```bash
   # After changing commit message locally
   git push --force-with-lease origin your-branch-name
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Only force push to your own feature branches, never to main/master!

### Example Implementation Structure

```python
def algorithm_name(param1: type1, param2: type2) -> return_type:
    """
    Brief description of what the algorithm does.

    Args:
        param1 (type1): Description of param1
        param2 (type2): Description of param2

    Returns:
        return_type: Description of return value

    Time Complexity: O(n)
    Space Complexity: O(1)

    Example:
        >>> algorithm_name(1, 2)
        3
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

## Documentation Guidelines

### Required Documentation
1. **Docstrings**: Every function and class must have a docstring that includes:
   - Brief description
   - Parameters and their types
   - Return value and type
   - Time and space complexity
   - Example usage

2. **Comments**:
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Explain any non-obvious decisions
   - Document any assumptions

3. **README**:
   - If adding a new category, include a README.md in that directory
   - Explain the concept
   - Include relevant resources and references

## Testing Guidelines

1. **Test Structure**
   - Place tests in the `tests/` directory
   - Follow the same structure as the main code
   - Name test files with `test_` prefix

2. **Test Requirements**
   - Include unit tests for all new functions
   - Test edge cases
   - Test expected failures
   - Aim for high test coverage

3. **Example Test**:
```python
def test_algorithm_name():
    # Arrange
    input_data = [1, 2, 3]
    expected_output = 6

    # Act
    result = algorithm_name(input_data)

    # Assert
    assert result == expected_output
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Before Submitting**
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Update documentation if needed
   - Add your changes to CHANGELOG.md if it exists
   - Squash related commits

2. **PR Description**
   - Clearly describe the changes
   - Link any related issues
   - Include example output if applicable
   - List any breaking changes

3. **Review Process**
   - Address review comments promptly
   - Keep discussions focused and professional
   - Be open to suggestions and feedback

4. **After Merging**
   - Delete your branch
   - Update your fork
   - Celebrate your contribution! üéâ
